/*For this lab, you will prompt the user for the student's name and 5 grades that will populate an array of doubles. 
Once the user has entered in all 5 grades, display the students's name and their average for all 5 grades entered.
Input:
Prompt the user for student name
Prompt the user for all 5 grades

Process / functions:
double AverageGrades(array) - takes the array as an argument and returns the average
void DisplayGrades(array) - function iterates through the array and displays all of the grades additionally, this function displays the student average


Output:
Student Name
Student grades
Student Average
