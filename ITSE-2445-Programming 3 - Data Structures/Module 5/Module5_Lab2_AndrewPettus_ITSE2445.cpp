Instructions:
----------------------
Objective
Understand the concept of call-by-reference variables in C++.

Understand the difference between call-by-value and call-by-reference variables.

Practice writing functions that use call-by-reference variables.

 Requirements

Write a void function called swapNumber that takes in two integers by reference and swaps their values. Test your function by calling it with two integers and printing out their values before and after the function call.

Write a void function called addXtoY that takes in an integer by reference X and increments its value by the value of Y. Test your function by calling it with an integer by reference for X and an integer for Y and printing out its value before and after the function call.

Notes - Ensure the functions you have created are prototyped before the main and defined after the main. 

Deliverable

Upload the following:
